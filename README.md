# Scrollytelling

A template to create a scrollytale of datapoints with context.

## [Demo](https://jimothyjohn.github.io/scrollytelling/)

## How-to

1. Configure your story in [data.js](data.js)

2. Put your graphics in [assets/](assets/)

3. Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser to view the story.

### Why?

"Just make a video instead...". You're missing the point. It needs to feel interactive. You're controlling the tempo and time to maximize your personal impact. The animation is a structure, not a decoration.
